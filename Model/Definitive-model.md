# Definitive Model
The definitive Model is given in [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/).

This directory contains one fully commented PlantUML (.puml) file for each Class, with the following exceptions:

|Class|File|
|---------|--------|
|Application|substance|
|Row|crop|

Relationships are included with the most relevant Class.

Much of the information in these files can be understood with little, or no knowledge of PlantUML, especially if the
lines beginning with exclamation marks are ignored.

These files are combined to create the UML diagrams with the [explanatory text](https://github.com/Charles1625/crop-production-ontology/blob/main/README.md#development-of-the-model).  The lines beginning with exclamation
marks are pre-processor commands to aid this combination.
