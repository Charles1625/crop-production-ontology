# Formal Definition of the Model
The formal definition of the Model is given in [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/).

This directory contain one fully commented PlantUML (.puml) file for each Class.

Much of the information in these files can be understood with little, or no knowledge of PlantUML, especially if the
lines beginning with exclamation marks are ignored.

These files are combined to create the UML diagrams in the explantory documents.  The lines beginning with exclamation
marks are pre-processor commands to aid this combination.
