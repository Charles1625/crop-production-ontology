# A Crop Production Ontology
As for many domains, there will presently be a need for large datasets (Big Data) to assist the 
development of artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions for crop production. 
Data in this domain currently exists in a wide range of formats, 
including those managed by a number of different applications in use by farmers. 
The first step in building the necessary datasets will be to agree a standard ontology. 
The challenge is to create a common language about crop production which can be used 
in a wide variety of situations, including those which might develop in the future.  

The output of this project will be:
- A Model based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML), formally describing things involved in crop production and how they relate to each other.
- A machine readable Schema based on the Model, against which datasets can be standardised so that they can be combined (See [Introduction to Schema]().

A series of explanatory documents are being written (listed below) which discuss the rationale behind the Model. 
These include UML Class Diagrams which formally define the relationships between things while
the text explains how these diagrams were arrived at.
Conceptually, the Model is a single diagram, but, for convenience, it is not presented as such. 
The terms used in the diagrams are fully defined in a separate document, the [Model Documentation](https://github.com/Charles1625/crop-production-ontology/blob/main/Model/Documentation.md).

>The meaning of the symbols in the diagrams will mostly become obvious from the text.  Any explanation required will be in paragraphs like this.

The sharing of this project through GitHub, allows collaboration between domain experts (e.g. farmers, agronomists, crop scientists) and data scientists who may raise Issues, or may make a more hands-on contribution.  

>Those wishing to do the latter will need to be, or become familiar with the [GitHub process](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).  Additionally, [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) is needed to modify, or contribute UML diagrams.
